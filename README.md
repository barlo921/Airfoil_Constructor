# Airfoil_Constructor

An airfoil is the cross-sectional shape of a wing, blade (of a propeller, rotor, or turbine), or sail (as seen in cross-section).

The NACA airfoils are airfoil shapes for aircraft wings developed by the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA). The shape of the NACA airfoils is described using a series of digits following the word &quot;NACA&quot;. The parameters in the numerical code can be entered into equations to precisely generate the cross-section of the airfoil and calculate its properties.

This program may help you to define specified airfoils by their codes. Hope it may help you to better understand airplanes or find graphical view of airfoil.
